      <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
      <p>
        Carbohydrates are a major source of energy of our body, and they come
        mainly from grains, such as rice and noodles. Besides, other foods such
        as fruit, root vegetables, dry beans and dairy products also contain
        carbohydrates.

      <h2>Fats</h2>
      <p>
        Fats can be found in foods such as meat, dairy products, nuts, seeds and
        edible oils. Fats serve as a kind of energy source. They prevent heat
        loss in extreme cold weather and protect organs against shock. They are
        responsible for making up part of our body cells and transporting
        fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin A, D, E and K.

      <h2>Minerals</h2>
      <p>
        Minerals are a group of essential nutrients which regulate many body
        functions such as fluid balance, muscle contraction and transmission of
        nerve impulses. Some minerals are structural component of the body, such
        as calcium in bones and teeth.

        <dt>Surface water</dt>
        <dd>
          Surface water is any body of water found on Earth's surface, including
          both the saltwater in the ocean and the freshwater in rivers, streams,
          and lakes. A body of surface water can persist all year long or for
          only part of the year.

        />
        <dt>Fresh water</dt>
        <dd>
          Fresh water or freshwater is any naturally occurring liquid or frozen
          water containing low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total
          dissolved solids. Although the term specifically excludes seawater and
          brackish water, it does include non-salty mineral-rich waters such as
          chalybeate springs. Fresh water may encompass frozen and meltwater in
          ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, snowfields and icebergs, natural
          precipitations such as rainfall, snowfall, hail/sleet and graupel, and
          surface runoffs that form inland bodies of water such as wetlands,
          ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, as well as groundwater contained in
          aquifers, subterranean rivers and lakes. Fresh water is the water
          resource that is of the most and immediate use to humans.

        <dt>Drinking water</dt>
        <dd>
          Drinking water or potable water is water that is safe for ingestion,
          either when drunk directly in liquid form or consumed indirectly
          through food preparation. It is often (but not always) supplied
          through taps, in which case it is also called tap water. Typically in
          developed countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards,
          even though only a small proportion is actually consumed or used in
          food preparation. Other typical uses for tap water include washing,
          toilets, and irrigation. Greywater may also be used for toilets or
          irrigation. Its use for irrigation however may be associated with
          risks.[
